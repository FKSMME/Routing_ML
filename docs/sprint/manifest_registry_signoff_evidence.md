# Manifest & Registry Compliance Sign-off Evidence

## Summary
- Confirmed alignment between `manifest.json` loading contract and the persisted metadata inside `registry.db`.
- Captured sign-off notes from architecture, backend, and operations stakeholders, including rollback guard-rails.
- Documented the evidence bundle paths to unblock the backend readiness track.

## Review Inputs
| Source | Version / Timestamp | Key Points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PRD.md ยง2.1-2.3 | v2025-09-28.1 | Maintains immutable model artifacts with mutable runtime configuration overrides. |
| docs/Design/onprem_two_tier_architecture.md | 2025-09-29 | Two-tier split mandates manifest-driven loading and registry activation toggles. |
| Tasklist absolute directives | 2025-09-29 | Requires hourly logging and contract validation prior to backend modifications. |

## Stakeholder Sign-offs
| Role | Representative | Evidence | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture Lead | A. Park | `deliverables/2025-09-29/architecture_manifest_registry_minutes.md` | Approved manifest key schema (`model_path`, `encoder`, `index`, `metadata`). |
| Backend Lead | B. Choi | `deliverables/2025-09-29/backend_registry_review.pdf` | Accepted registry table (`model_registry`) with `version`, `active_flag`, `created_at`, `notes`. |
| Operations Lead | C. Kim | `deliverables/2025-09-29/operations_rollforward_plan.xlsx` | Confirmed hot reload procedure and rollback playbook referencing `active_flag`. |

## Compliance Checklist
- [x] Manifest schema validated against existing `models/<version>` artifacts.
- [x] Registry activation/rollback path walkthrough complete.
- [x] Training metadata compatibility record verified (Python, sklearn, joblib versions).

## Follow-up Actions
1. Publish approved manifest template alongside runtime configuration samples.
2. Generate migration script skeleton for promoting registry schema to production.
3. Add monitoring hook for manifest/registry divergence alerts.
