# Codex HTTPS Follow-Up (2025-10-20 21:10~21:45 KST)

## Completed
- 21:12 KST - Reviewed `frontend-home/server.js` to confirm the `USE_HTTPS` guard and redirect handling are active.
- 21:20 KST - Checked static HTML entry points to ensure `API_BASE` remains relative for proxy-friendly HTTPS access.
- 21:32 KST - Updated operational docs (`docs/BUILD_COMPLETE.md`, `docs/deploy/windows/QUICK_START_GUIDE.md`, `docs/deploy/windows/server_deployment_2025-10-13.md`, `docs/guides/UPDATE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`, `docs/guides/OPERATIONAL_RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/implementation/2025-10-17-domain-configuration-rtml-ksm-co-kr.md`, `docs/implementation/2025-10-17-server-monitor-https-update.md`, `docs/guides/frontend-home/SQL_VIEW_EXPLORER_GUIDE.md`, `docs/reports/root/TODAY_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`) to reflect the enforced HTTPS endpoints.
- 21:40 KST - Verified HTTP redirect and HTTPS messaging coverage in the updated documentation set.

## Pending
- 21:45 KST - Test `run_frontend_home.bat` with the production certificate pair to confirm HTTPS startup without manual edits.
- 21:45 KST - Validate the HTTP redirect port (`HTTP_REDIRECT_PORT=3080`) against firewall rules in staging and production.
- 21:45 KST - Review Grafana and other non-home services to ensure remaining HTTP references are intentional and documented.
