## üö® Risk Management

### High Risks

#### Risk 1: Production Deployment Downtime
**Impact**: Critical
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Database migration tested on staging
- Rollback plan documented
- Deployment during low-traffic window

**Rollback Plan**:
```bash
# Revert to previous Docker images
cd /opt/routing-ml
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate

# Rollback database (if needed)
docker-compose exec backend python -m alembic downgrade -1
```

---

#### Risk 2: CI/CD Pipeline Blocking Development
**Impact**: High
**Probability**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Pipeline optimized for speed (<15min)
- Ability to bypass on emergency (manual approval)
- Clear failure messages
- Fast feedback on errors

---

#### Risk 3: Monitoring Alert Fatigue
**Impact**: Medium
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Tune alert thresholds carefully
- Use alert grouping
- Implement on-call rotation
- Regular alert review and tuning

---

### Medium Risks

#### Risk 4: Frontend Common Package Breaking Changes
**Impact**: Medium
**Probability**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Gradual migration (component by component)
- 100% test coverage required
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Easy rollback (git revert)
