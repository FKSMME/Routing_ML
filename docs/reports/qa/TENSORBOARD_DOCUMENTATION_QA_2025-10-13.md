# TensorBoard Navigation QA Audit (2025-10-13)

## Scope
- Reviewed all Markdown files under `docs/` to validate TensorBoard-related guidance against the current application state.
- Cross-checked front-end navigation (`frontend-training/src/App.tsx`) and TensorBoard workspace implementation (`frontend-training/src/components/workspaces/TensorboardWorkspace.tsx`) versus documented instructions.

## Quantitative Summary
| Metric | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Total Markdown documents under `docs/` | 314 |
| Documents mentioning “TensorBoard” | 18 |
| Documents mentioning “TensorBoard” **and** “menu” (i.e., reference navigation) | 1 |
| Documents still referencing `ModelTrainingPanel` component | 2 |
| Documents mentioning “TensorBoard” **and** `ModelTrainingPanel` together | 0 |

## Findings
1. **Navigation gap in docs**  
   - Only `docs/logs/IMPROVEMENT_LOG.md` alludes to a TensorBoard menu; the other 17 TensorBoard-related docs do not explain the new dedicated navigation entry (`tensorboard`).  
   - Recommendation: update key guides (e.g., `docs/guides/install_guide_ko.md`, `docs/guides/quickstart_guide.md`) to point users to the new TensorBoard menu.

2. **Residual `ModelTrainingPanel` references**  
   - `docs/guides/STAGING_ENVIRONMENT_TESTING_GUIDE.md` still instructs users to open the “모델 학습” menu to validate `ModelTrainingPanel`. This is still correct for training controls, but no TensorBoard context is provided.  
   - `docs/logs/WORK_LOG_2025-10-09_P2_IMPROVEMENTS.md` captures historical work; no action needed, but it does not mention the new workspace.

3. **Plan alignment**  
   - `docs/guides/frontend-training/TENSORBOARD_EMBEDDING_VIEWER_PLAN.md` now states that a dedicated TensorBoard workspace exists, matching the current implementation. No further action required here.

4. **Implementation check**  
   - Front-end navigation now exposes a `tensorboard` item (`frontend-training/src/App.tsx`), rendering `TensorboardWorkspace`.  
   - `ModelTrainingPanel` no longer embeds the TensorBoard panel (`frontend-training/src/components/ModelTrainingPanel.tsx`), keeping roles separated as designed.

## Recommended Actions
1. Update the top-level onboarding/installation guides to instruct users to open the new **TensorBoard** menu (at minimum, `install_guide_ko.md`, `quickstart_guide.md`, and `monthly_retraining_setup.md`).
2. Add a release note or changelog entry clarifying that TensorBoard visualization moved from “모델 학습” to its own menu (helpful for returning users).
3. Consider adding a short navigation hint block to `TensorboardWorkspace` documentation to reduce future regressions (e.g., mention background color palette alignment, auto-refresh behavior).
