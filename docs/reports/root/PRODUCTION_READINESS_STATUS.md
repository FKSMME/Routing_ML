## Technical Accomplishments

### Backend Enhancements

#### 1. Model Quality Metrics (P2-1)
**File**: `backend/api/services/model_metrics.py` (NEW)

**Capabilities**:
- Automated accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score calculation
- Dataset statistics (sample counts, unique items/processes, missing rates)
- Auto-save `metrics.json` with each trained model
- sklearn-based implementation for industry-standard metrics

**Example Output** (`metrics.json`):
```json
{
  "training_samples": 1500,
  "dataset_stats": {
    "total_samples": 1500,
    "unique_items": 120,
    "unique_processes": 45,
    "missing_item_code": 0.0,
    "missing_process_code": 0.0,
    "missing_duration_min": 0.12
  },
  "training_duration_sec": 3.45,
  "created_at": "2025-10-09T14:32:10Z"
}
```

**Integration**:
- Modified `training_service.py` to auto-collect and save metrics
- Non-blocking (failures logged as warnings, don't abort training)

---

#### 2. Cache Invalidation (P2-2)
**File**: `backend/api/services/prediction_service.py`

**New Method**: `ManifestLoader.invalidate(model_dir=None)`

**Features**:
- Thread-safe cache clearing with lock protection
- Targeted invalidation (specific model) or full cache clear
- Logs invalidation events for debugging
- Complements existing mtime-based auto-refresh

**Usage**:
```python
# Clear all cached manifests
prediction_service.manifest_loader.invalidate()

# Clear specific model cache
from pathlib import Path
prediction_service.manifest_loader.invalidate(Path("models/my-model-v2"))
```

---

### Frontend Enhancements

#### 3. Model Training UI
**File**: `frontend-training/src/components/ModelTrainingPanel.tsx` (NEW)

**Before**: CLI-only workflow
```bash
python -m backend.cli.train_model dataset.csv --version my-model-v2
```

**After**: One-click web interface with:
- ✅ Version naming (manual or auto-generated timestamps)
- ✅ Dry-run mode toggle for safe testing
- ✅ Real-time progress monitoring (0-100%)
- ✅ Status polling every 3 seconds
- ✅ Job ID tracking
- ✅ Duration display
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Visual indicators (progress bars, status badges)

**Technical Details**:
- Integrated with `/api/trainer/run` endpoint (changed from 403 to 202)
- Polling stops after 5 minutes or completion
- Uses Tailwind CSS (no Material-UI dependencies)
- TypeScript type-safe implementation

---

## Known Issues

### 1. Git Repository Timeout (Current Session)
**Severity**: Low (infrastructure issue, not code issue)

**Description**: Git operations (`status`, `commit`) timeout after 10-45 seconds, even with small changesets.

**Impact**:
- Code changes complete and working
- Files staged successfully
- Only commit operation blocked

**Root Cause**: Unknown - possibly:
- WSL2 filesystem performance issues
- Large git repository (195MB)
- CRLF conversion processing delays
- Background git process stuck

**Workaround**:
1. Files are staged and ready to commit
2. Can commit manually in native terminal:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: Add model metrics and training UI (P2-1, P2-2)"
   ```
3. Or wait for git process to complete naturally

**Files Ready to Commit**:
- `backend/api/services/model_metrics.py` (NEW)
- `backend/api/services/prediction_service.py` (MODIFIED)
- `backend/api/services/training_service.py` (MODIFIED)
- `frontend-training/src/components/ModelTrainingPanel.tsx` (NEW)

---

### 2. AI Audit Accuracy
**Observation**: AI audit reported 3 P1 defects, but only 1 was legitimate.

**False Positives**:
- P1-1: TimeAggregator not using Polars → Already using Polars, 21/21 benchmarks passing
- P1-2: ERP export not implemented → Already implemented with Zustand store

**True Positive**:
- P1-3: Missing CI system dependencies → Fixed by adding unixODBC packages

**Accuracy**: 33% (1/3 correct) for P1 tasks, 100% (2/2 correct) for P0 tasks

**Lesson**: Manual verification essential for AI-generated issue reports.
