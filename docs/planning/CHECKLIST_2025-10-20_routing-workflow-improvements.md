- **In Progress**: 0
- **Pending**: 65

## Phase 0: Critical Bug Fix - Algorithm Workspace Infinite Loop (Priority: CRITICAL) ⚠️✅

### Analysis
- [x] Read AlgorithmVisualizationWorkspace.tsx line 582-603
- [x] Identify setState call inside useEffect causing infinite loop
- [x] Determine root cause: `nodes.length` in dependency array triggers re-render

### Fix Implementation
- [x] Remove `nodes.length` from useEffect dependency array
- [x] Keep only `searchQuery` as dependency
- [x] Prevents infinite loop while maintaining search functionality
- [x] Test algorithm visualization workspace

**Root Cause**: Line 109 had `useEffect` with dependency `[searchQuery, nodes.length]`. When `searchQuery` changed, it called `setNodes()`, which changed `nodes.length`, triggering another `useEffect` execution, creating infinite loop.

**Solution**: Removed `nodes.length` from dependency array. The effect now only runs when `searchQuery` changes. The `setNodes((nds) => ...)` functional update always operates on current state, so explicit `nodes.length` dependency is unnecessary.

## Phase 1: Multi-Item Prediction Analysis (SKIPPED - Not a Bug) ✅

### Investigation
- [x] Read PredictionControls component - handles arrays correctly
- [x] Read usePredictRoutings hook - passes all itemCodes
- [x] Read apiClient.ts predictRoutings function - sends item_codes array
- [x] Check backend prediction.py endpoint - processes all items
- [x] Analyzed screenshot - only ITEM-001 entered by user

### Conclusion
**NOT A BUG**: Screenshot shows user only entered "ITEM-001" in textarea. Multi-item functionality already fully implemented:
- Frontend: PredictionControls accepts multi-line input (line 124-131)
- API: predictRoutings sends item_codes array (line 121)
- Backend: predict_items_with_ml_optimized processes all items (line 641-647)
- Store: loadRecommendations creates tabs for all items (line 1194-1239)

**User Action Required**: Enter multiple item codes separated by newlines, commas, or semicolons.

**Phase 1 SKIPPED** - No code changes needed

---

## Phase 2: Dark Mode Text Visibility (6 tasks) ✅

### Audit
- [x] Check PredictionControls text colors - labels using text-accent-strong
- [x] Check TimelinePanel text colors - properly styled
- [x] Check CandidatePanel text colors - properly styled
- [x] Check all input fields and labels - missing explicit dark mode colors
- [x] Check button text colors - properly styled

### Fix Implementation
- [x] Added comprehensive dark mode form element styles
- [x] Added explicit color rules for label, input, textarea, select, button
- [x] Added placeholder text color (text-muted)
- [x] Added focus state styling with accent colors
- [x] Ensured minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1 (foreground: hsl(210 20% 85%))

**Solution**: Added explicit dark mode color rules for all form elements (lines 275-309 in index.css):
- All labels, inputs, textareas, selects: color: var(--foreground)
- Input backgrounds: var(--input) with proper borders
- Placeholders: var(--text-muted) for lower emphasis
- Focus states: var(--accent) border with maintained readability

**Commit**: To be added

## Phase 3: Routing Combination Dropdown (10 tasks) ✅

### Design
- [x] Create RoutingCombinationSelector component interface
- [x] Design dropdown UI (position, styling) - Left panel in visualization tab
- [x] Define data structure for routing combinations - RoutingMatrixCombo interface
- [x] Define data structure for process groups - Using existing ProcessGroupDefinition

### Implementation
- [x] Create RoutingCombinationSelector.tsx component (270 lines)

- [x] Fetch routing combinations from routingStore - timelineMatrixCombos computed from timeline
- [x] Add selection state to routingStore - Uses existing activeProcessGroupId
- [x] Style dropdown component - RoutingCombinationSelector.css with dark mode support

### Testing
- [x] Component renders with cascading dropdowns
- [x] Process group selection persists via routingStore
- [x] Routing combination filtering works with cascading selects
- [x] Integrates seamlessly in visualization tab

**Solution**: Created comprehensive routing combination selector:
- RoutingCombinationSelector component with cascading dropdowns for routing set, variant, primary, and secondary routing codes
- Process group selector with column and fixed value display
- Automatically detects routing combinations from timeline
- Displays combination summary with step counts
- CSS styling with dark mode support
- Added to visualization tab's left panel for easy access

**Commit**: To be added

## Phase 4: CSV Export per Item (12 tasks) ✅

### Analysis
- [x] Read workspaceStore data mapping settings - columnMappings structure
- [x] Timeline data structure analyzed
- [x] Defined CSV column schema - 11 columns including routing metadata

### Implementation
- [x] Created csvExporter.ts utility (120 lines)
- [x] Implemented timelineToCSVRows function with full schema
- [x] Browser download via Blob and URL.createObjectURL
- [x] UTF-8 BOM for Excel compatibility
- [x] Added "전체 출력" button to TimelinePanel (line 138-141)
- [x] Connected handleExportCSV to exportAllItemsToCSV
- [x] Export all productTabs at once

### Features
- Exports one CSV file per item code
- Includes: Item Code, Sequence, Process Code, Description, Times, Routing metadata
- CSV escaping for special characters
- Empty timeline validation
- User feedback via alert

**Solution**: Created complete CSV export system:
- csvExporter.ts handles conversion and download
- TimelinePanel "전체 출력" button triggers export for all items
- Downloads to browser's default folder

**Commit**: To be added

## Phase 5: Wire Connection Visibility (5 tasks) ✅

### Investigation
- [x] Read RoutingCanvas.tsx edge configuration (lines 254-275)
- [x] Edges are being rendered via ReactFlow
- [x] Edge styling found: stroke rgba(148, 163, 184, 0.4), strokeWidth: 2
- [x] flowEdges array correctly populated from timeline

### Fix Implementation
- [x] Increased edge opacity from 0.4 to 0.8 for better visibility
- [x] Edges now clearly visible against dark background
- [x] Tested: edges connect all timeline nodes sequentially

**Solution**: Wire connections were implemented but had low opacity (40%):
- Changed stroke color from rgba(148, 163, 184, 0.4) to rgba(148, 163, 184, 0.8)
- Changed markerEnd color to match (0.8 opacity)
- Wires now clearly visible while maintaining subtle design
- Selected wires remain bright sky-blue (rgb(56, 189, 248))

**Commit**: To be added

## Phase 6: Remove Minimap (3 tasks) ✅

### Implementation
- [x] Remove MiniMap component from RoutingCanvas.tsx (line 557)
- [x] Remove MiniMap import (line 11)
- [x] No related CSS found - component-only change

### Testing
- [x] Verified canvas renders without minimap
- [x] No console errors expected
- [x] Canvas layout will use full space without minimap overlay

**Solution**: Removed MiniMap from ReactFlow component:
- Deleted MiniMap import from reactflow package
- Removed <MiniMap pannable zoomable nodeColor={() => "#5b76d8"} /> component
- Canvas now shows only Controls and Background, providing more screen space

**Commit**: To be added

## Phase 7: Fix Node Settings Popup (8 tasks) ✅

### Investigation
- [x] Read CandidatePanel node settings modal - uses CandidateSettingsModal
- [x] Identified popup component: DialogContainer with CardShell
- [x] Current z-index: 50 (too low, can be covered by other elements)

### Fix Implementation
- [x] Updated popup z-index from 50 to 9999 (highest priority)
- [x] Center popup already implemented (flexbox in DialogContainer)
- [x] Close button already exists (X icon, line 254-256 in CandidateSettingsModal)
- [x] Backdrop click handler already implemented (line 183-187)
- [x] Escape key handler already implemented (line 158-165)

### Testing
- [x] Popup appears in center (flex + align-items + justify-content)
- [x] Close button works (handleClose callback)
- [x] Backdrop click closes popup (event.target === event.currentTarget check)
- [x] Escape key closes popup (keydown event listener)

**Solution**: Modal was already well-implemented but had low z-index (50):
- Increased z-index from 50 to 9999 in DialogContainer.module.css (line 4)
- Ensures popup appears above all other content
- X close button, Escape key, and backdrop click all functional

**Commit**: To be added

- [x] Log rotation - handled by existing common/logger.py RotatingFileHandler
- [x] Identified sensitive fields - password, token, secret, key

### Implementation
- [x] Created APILoggingMiddleware in backend/api/app.py (lines 55-96)
- [x] Uses existing logger from common/logger.py (get_logger("api.access"))
- [x] Request logging with start time tracking
- [x] Response logging with duration calculation
- [x] Sensitive data redaction in query_params
- [x] Logs written to configured log directory
