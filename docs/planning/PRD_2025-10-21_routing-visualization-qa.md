# PRD — Routing Visualization Canvas & Recommendation QA (2025-10-21)

## Executive Summary
- Provide a comprehensive QA assessment of the routing creation page, focusing on the canvas visualization workflows and the recommendation subsystem.
- Validate that visual nodes/wires, recommendation panes, and interaction triggers align with business requirements and technical specifications.
- Deliver quantified metrics (latency, data freshness, coverage) to support remediation planning.

## Problem Statement
Stakeholders reported functional gaps between predicted routings and how they surface within the canvas UI, particularly around recommendation nodes, similarity lists, and user-triggered routing previews. Existing QA documentation does not cover the current feature set or provide quantitative evidence for performance/regression risks. A structured audit is required to confirm end-to-end behavior from backend services to frontend rendering.

## Goals and Objectives
1. Map the data flow from prediction API outputs to canvas node rendering and recommendation panels.
2. Verify that recommendation interactions (node selection, drag/drop, acceptance) update the canvas consistently and trigger backend updates where required.
3. Measure quantitative indicators (response times, node counts, error rates, stale data ratios) across representative scenarios.
4. Identify defects, inconsistencies, or missing features relative to product requirements, prioritizing fixes with clear reproduction steps.

## Requirements
- Inventory frontend components (`frontend-prediction`) responsible for canvas rendering and recommendation panels, including state management hooks.
- Inspect backend services feeding the UI (prediction endpoints, websocket/subscription layers if present).
- Collect metrics: API latency, frame render durations (if available), count of recommended nodes versus predicted candidates, interaction success/error rates.
- Evaluate logging/telemetry already in place and highlight gaps.
- Produce a QA report with evidence, reproduction steps, and recommended remediation priorities.

## Phase Breakdown
### Phase 1 — Recon & Documentation
- Gather specs, review relevant PRDs/design docs, enumerate components/services.
- Document source-of-truth data contracts (API schemas, store shapes).

### Phase 2 — Functional Audit
- Execute end-to-end flows in staging/logs.
- Verify recommendation-to-canvas synchronization, user actions, and error handling.

### Phase 3 — Metrics & Reporting
- Aggregate quantitative data (latency, node counts, error ratios).
- Draft QA report with findings, severity ratings, and follow-up actions.

## Success Criteria
- Every canvas and recommendation interaction path documented with pass/fail status.
- Quantitative metrics captured for key performance indicators.
- Defect list with severity/priority delivered to stakeholders.
- QA report stored under `deliverables/` with timestamp.

## Timeline Estimates
- Phase 1: 0.5 day
- Phase 2: 1.0 day
- Phase 3: 0.5 day
- Total: 2.0 days (assuming uninterrupted access to environment/logs)
