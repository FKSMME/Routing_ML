## Dependencies

### Required Before Start

- ✅ API client infrastructure exists

### Required During

- [ ] Access to backend server for testing
- [ ] Chart library (if not already available)
- [ ] Clipboard API support in browser

---

## Notes

### Important Reminders

1. Update checkboxes [ ] → [x] immediately after each task
2. Commit and merge to main after EACH phase
3. Always return to 251014 branch after merging
4. Do not proceed to next phase until all tasks in current phase are [x]
5. Update Progress Tracking section after each task

### Backend API Endpoints

```
GET /data-quality/metrics       (Line 25)
GET /data-quality/report        (Line 50)
GET /data-quality/prometheus    (Line 84)
GET /data-quality/health        (Line 124)
```

## Risk Mitigation

### If Backend Returns Different Schema

- Stop implementation
- Document actual schema
- Update TypeScript interfaces
- Continue implementation

### If Auto-Refresh Causes Performance Issues

- Add debouncing
- Reduce refresh frequency
- Add manual refresh option
- Add disable auto-refresh toggle

### If Visualization Library Needed

- Check if recharts or chart.js already installed
- If not, add lightweight chart library
- Keep charts simple (line charts only)

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative

- 0 → 100% integration for Data Quality endpoints
- 0 → 4 working panels
- 0 → 62 completed tasks

### Qualitative

- Users can monitor data quality
- Issues are visible and actionable
- Health status is clear
- Prometheus integration available
