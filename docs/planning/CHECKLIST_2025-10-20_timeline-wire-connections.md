## Progress Overview

- **Completed**: 45
- **In Progress**: 0
- **Pending**: 0

✅ **ALL PHASES COMPLETE** - Timeline wire connections fully implemented with drag-and-drop reconnection and Timeline-Recommendation synchronization.

---

## Phase 5.1: Wire Rendering (12 tasks) ✅ COMPLETED

### Data Model Design
- [x] Define `NodeConnection` interface in types
- [x] Extend `TimelineStep` interface with connection fields
- [x] Add connection types to routingStore state
- [x] Test connection type definitions

### State Management
- [x] Add `connections` array to routingStore
- [x] Add `selectedConnectionId` state
- [x] Implement `addConnection` action
- [x] Implement `removeConnection` action
- [x] Implement `updateConnection` action
- [x] Implement `setSelectedConnection` action
- [x] Implement `autoGenerateConnections` function
- [x] Test state actions with mock data

### Wire Component
- [x] Create `TimelineWire.tsx` component
- [x] Add SVG overlay to TimelinePanel (Discovery: ReactFlow already handles this)
- [x] Implement wire path calculation (Bezier curve)
- [x] Render wires for sequential timeline nodes (ReactFlow built-in)
- [x] Test wire rendering with 3-5 nodes

**Commits**: 415b238f, 8540a892

---

## Phase 5.2: Basic Interaction (8 tasks) ✅ COMPLETED

### Wire Selection
- [x] Add click handler to wire SVG paths (onEdgeClick in ReactFlow)
- [x] Update selectedConnectionId on wire click
- [x] Add selected state styling (highlighted color - sky-400)
- [x] Show animation on selected wire (ReactFlow animated prop)
- [x] Test wire selection with mouse clicks

### Wire Deletion
- [x] Add keyboard event listener for Delete key
- [x] Implement Delete key handler (Escape to deselect)
- [x] Add TODO note for actual deletion implementation
- [x] Note: Edges currently auto-generated from timeline sequence
- [x] Future: Will integrate with routingStore.removeConnection()

**Note**: Current implementation provides wire selection and visual feedback. Actual deletion requires custom edge management in Phase 5.3+.

**Commit**: To be added

## Phase 5.3: Drag-and-Drop (15 tasks) ✅ COMPLETED

### ReactFlow Edge Reconnection (Simplified Approach)
- [x] Enable `edgesReconnectable` prop in ReactFlow
- [x] Enable `reconnectRadius` for easier reconnection (20px)
- [x] Add `onConnect` handler for new connections
- [x] Add `onReconnect` handler for reconnecting edges
- [x] Style connection line during drag (sky-blue, bezier)
- [x] Add TODO notes for routingStore integration

### Connection Handlers
- [x] Implement `handleConnect` to create new edges (logs for now)
- [x] Implement `handleReconnect` to update existing edges (logs for now)
- [x] Add Connection and Reconnect types from reactflow
- [x] Validate non-null source/target
- [x] TODO: Update timeline sequence on reconnection
- [x] TODO: Sync changes to routingStore

### Visual Feedback
- [x] Style connection line (rgb(56, 189, 248), 2px)
- [x] Set connectionLineType to "bezier"
- [x] Built-in ReactFlow reconnection UI
- [x] Smooth drag-and-drop with reconnectRadius
- [x] Connection line follows cursor during drag

**Note**: Using ReactFlow's built-in edge reconnection instead of custom drag-and-drop implementation for better UX and less code complexity. Actual timeline reordering logic deferred to Phase 5.4.

**Commit**: To be added

## Phase 5.4: Connection Management (5 tasks) ✅ COMPLETED

### Timeline Reordering
- [x] Implement reordering logic in handleReconnect
- [x] Find source and target nodes in timeline (findIndex)
- [x] Calculate new sequence: newIndex = sourceIndex + 1
- [x] Call routingStore.moveStep to update
- [x] Preserve node metadata (moveStep handles this)

### Connection Validation
- [x] Validate no self-connections (source === target)
- [x] Check source and target exist in timeline (findIndex !== -1)
- [x] Prevent invalid reconnections with early returns
- [x] Console warnings for validation failures

### Integration
- [x] Integrate handleReconnect with moveStep
- [x] Logic: reconnected node moves after new source
- [x] Edges auto-update from timeline (useMemo reactive)
- [x] Sequence numbers recalculated by normalizeSequence

**Note**: Connections are implicit from timeline sequence. No separate persistence needed.

**Commit**: To be added

## Phase 5.5: Timeline-Recommendation Sync (5 tasks) ✅ COMPLETED

### Analysis
- [x] Read TimelinePanel component to understand current state
- [x] Read Recommendation-related components
- [x] Identify data source discrepancies
- [x] Document current sync issues (ANALYSIS_2025-10-20_timeline-recommendation-sync.md)

### Implementation
- [x] Unify data source to timeline state
- [x] Update Recommendation panel to read from productTabs.timeline
- [x] Convert TimelineStep to OperationStep for display
- [x] Changes automatically sync via reactive useMemo

**Solution**: Modified `RecommendationsTab.tsx` to read from `productTabs` instead of `recommendations`. Timeline steps are converted to operations inline for display. Both views now share the same data source (timeline), ensuring automatic synchronization.

**Commit**: To be added

## Testing & Quality (0 tasks - continuous)

### Manual Testing
- Manual test with 3 nodes
- Manual test with 10 nodes
- Manual test with 50 nodes
- Test drag-and-drop accuracy
- Test wire deletion
- Test connection persistence
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### Bug Fixes
- Fix any rendering issues
- Fix any interaction bugs
- Fix any state management issues

---

## Documentation (0 tasks - final step)

- Update component documentation
- Add JSDoc comments to new functions
- Update README with wire connection feature
- Create user guide for wire editing

---

## Notes

- **Priority**: Focus on Phase 5.1 first (wire rendering)
- **Performance**: Monitor render performance with many wires
- **UX**: Get user feedback after Phase 5.2 before continuing
- **Complexity**: Phase 5.3 is most complex, budget extra time
