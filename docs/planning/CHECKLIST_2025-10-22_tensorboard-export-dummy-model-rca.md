# Checklist â€” TensorBoard Export Dummy Model RCA

- [x] Phase 1: Inventory projector artifacts and capture metrics (1.0h)
- [x] Phase 1: Document backend export endpoint parameter flow (1.0h)
- [x] Phase 2: Trace frontend default selection logic for projectors (0.8h)
- [x] Phase 2: Validate active model resolution vs export script arguments (1.2h)
- [x] Phase 2: Compile evidence package (timestamps, vector counts, logs) (0.5h)
- [x] Phase 3: Draft mitigation proposals with KPIs and ownership (0.7h)
- [x] Phase 3: Define verification steps (tests, monitoring hooks) (0.5h)
- [x] Phase 3: Produce bilingual-ready stakeholder report (0.6h)

## Dependencies
- Backend settings loader (`backend/api/config.py`) must expose actual active model path.
- TensorBoard store (`frontend-training/src/store/tensorboardStore.ts`) availability for inspection.
- Access to logs under `logs/` for evidence timelines.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Checklist items checked with evidence references (file path + timestamp).
- Quantitative metrics recorded for dummy vs production exports.
- Mitigation plan includes responsible module(s) and measurable goal.
