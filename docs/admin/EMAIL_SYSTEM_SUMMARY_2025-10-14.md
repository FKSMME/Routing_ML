## What Works Now

### ✅ Backend Complete

1. **User Registration with Email**
   - Users can provide email and full name during registration
   - Admin receives cyberpunk-styled notification email
   - Registration succeeds even if email sending fails (logged as warning)

2. **User Approval Notification**
   - When admin approves user, approval email sent automatically
   - Email includes login instructions and welcome message
   - Cyberpunk-themed HTML design

3. **User Rejection Notification**
   - When admin rejects user, rejection email sent automatically
   - Optional rejection reason included in email
   - Encourages user to contact admin

4. **Database Migration**
   - Automatic migration adds email/full_name columns to existing databases
   - No manual SQL required
   - Backward compatible with existing users

5. **Error Handling**
   - Email failures logged but don't block operations
   - Registration/approval/rejection succeed regardless of email status
   - All failures recorded in audit log

---

## What's Left to Do

### 🔧 Frontend Integration Required

**Location:** Frontend registration form (exact path depends on your frontend structure)

**Changes Needed:**
1. Add "Full Name" text input field
2. Add "Email Address" text input field
3. Update registration form submission to include new fields
4. Optional: Add email validation (format check)

**Example Form Data:**
```javascript
const registrationData = {
  username: "john_doe",
  password: "secure_password",
  display_name: "John",
  full_name: "John Doe",           // NEW
  email: "john.doe@company.com"    // NEW
};
```

## Testing Instructions

### Backend Testing (Can Test Now)

1. **Configure Email Settings**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables
   export EMAIL_ENABLED=true
   export EMAIL_SENDER=your-email@company.com
   export EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
   export EMAIL_ADMIN=admin@company.com
   ```

2. **Test Registration with curl**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "username": "testuser",
       "password": "testpass123",
       "display_name": "Test User",
       "full_name": "Test User Full Name",
       "email": "testuser@company.com"
     }'
   ```

3. **Check Admin Email**
   - Admin should receive registration notification
   - Check spam folder if not in inbox

4. **Test Approval (via Server Monitor)**
   - Use Server Monitor to approve the test user
   - Check testuser@company.com for approval notification

5. **Check Logs**
   ```bash
   # Look for email-related log entries
   grep "이메일" logs/auth.service.*.log
   ```

### Frontend Testing (After Integration)

1. Open registration page
2. Fill out form including new email field
3. Submit registration
4. Verify admin receives email
5. Approve via Server Monitor
6. Verify user receives approval email

## Security & Privacy

### ✅ Security Measures
- Email passwords stored in environment variables only
- TLS encryption enabled for SMTP connections
- Email addresses not exposed in public APIs
- Only authenticated admin can view user emails

### ✅ Privacy
- Email field is optional (users can skip)
- Email only used for notifications
- No email sharing with third parties
- Users informed about email usage

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: No emails received

**Solutions:**
1. Check EMAIL_ENABLED=true
2. Verify SMTP credentials
3. Check spam/junk folder
4. Review audit logs for "이메일 전송 실패"
5. Test SMTP connection manually

### Problem: SMTP authentication fails

**Solutions:**
1. Use MS365 app-specific password (more secure)
2. Enable SMTP AUTH in Exchange Online
3. Check account permissions
4. Verify smtp.office365.com:587 is accessible

### Problem: Email sent but not styled correctly

**Solutions:**
1. Check recipient email client (Outlook recommended)
2. Some email clients strip CSS - plain text fallback included
3. Test in different email clients

⚠️ "거절 이메일 전송 실패" - Rejection notification failed
```
