# Email Notification System Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Author:** Development Team
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Overview

Implemented MS365 Outlook-based email notification system for user registration workflow. The system sends automated email notifications to administrators when users register and to users when their registration is approved or rejected.

---

## Implementation Timeline

### Session 1: 2025-10-14

**Time:** Start - Present

**Objectives:**
- Implement MS365 Outlook email integration
- Add email notifications for user registration workflow
- Remove password recovery feature (already compliant - no password recovery exists)
- Update database schema to support email addresses

---

## Files Modified

### 1. Backend Configuration
**File:** `backend/api/config.py`
- **Changes:** Added 7 new email-related configuration fields to Settings class
- **Purpose:** Configure MS365 Outlook SMTP settings (server, port, credentials, admin email)

### 2. Email Service (New)
**File:** `backend/api/services/email_service.py`
- **Changes:** Created new email service module
- **Purpose:** Handle all email sending operations with cyberpunk-themed HTML templates
- **Features:**
  - `send_email()`: Core SMTP email sending
  - `notify_admin_new_registration()`: Alert admin of new registration
  - `notify_user_approved()`: Notify user of approval with login instructions
  - `notify_user_rejected()`: Notify user of rejection with optional reason

### 3. Database Schema
**File:** `backend/database_rsl.py`
- **Changes:** Added `full_name` and `email` columns to UserAccount model
- **Purpose:** Store user contact information for notifications

### 4. API Schemas
**File:** `backend/api/schemas.py`
- **Changes:** Added `full_name` and `email` fields to RegisterRequest schema
- **Purpose:** Accept email and full name during registration

### 5. Authentication Service
**File:** `backend/api/services/auth_service.py`
- **Changes:** Integrated email_service into registration and approval workflow
- **Purpose:** Send email notifications at key workflow points
- **Integration Points:**
  - `register()`: Store email/full_name, send admin notification
  - `approve_user()`: Send user approval email
  - `reject_user()`: Send user rejection email

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Admin Notification on Registration
- **Trigger:** User submits registration request
- **Recipient:** Admin (configured in EMAIL_ADMIN env var)
- **Content:** Username, full name, email of new registrant
- **Design:** Cyberpunk-themed HTML email with neon aesthetics

### 2. User Approval Notification
- **Trigger:** Admin approves user registration
- **Recipient:** User's registered email address
- **Content:** Approval confirmation with login instructions
- **Design:** Cyberpunk-themed success notification

### 3. User Rejection Notification
- **Trigger:** Admin rejects user registration
- **Recipient:** User's registered email address
- **Content:** Rejection notice with optional reason
- **Design:** Cyberpunk-themed rejection notification

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Email notification settings
EMAIL_ENABLED=true
EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.office365.com
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_SENDER=your-email@company.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password-or-password
EMAIL_ADMIN=admin@company.com
EMAIL_USE_TLS=true
```

### MS365 Outlook Setup
1. Use organization MS365 account
2. Enable SMTP authentication in Exchange settings
3. Consider using app-specific password for security
4. Ensure sender account has permission to send via SMTP

---

## Password Recovery Compliance

**Requirement:** Remove password recovery feature, only allow admin-approved password resets

**Status:** ✅ COMPLIANT

**Analysis:**
- No password recovery or "forgot password" endpoints exist in `backend/api/routes/auth.py`
- Only password change endpoint exists: `/change-password`
- `/change-password` requires current authentication (user must be logged in)
- Password changes require current password verification
- No self-service password reset available
- Admin must manually reset passwords or users must use existing password change flow

**Conclusion:** System already meets requirement - no changes needed

---

## Database Migration Notes

### New Columns Added to `UserAccount` Table

```sql
-- These columns are added via SQLAlchemy ORM on next bootstrap
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN full_name VARCHAR(255) NULL;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(255) NULL;
```

**Migration Behavior:**
- `bootstrap_schema()` in database_rsl.py handles schema updates
- Columns are nullable to support existing users
- Existing users can update email/full_name via profile update (future feature)

---

## Error Handling

### Email Sending Failures
- All email sending operations are wrapped in try-except blocks
- Failures are logged but do not block the primary operation
- If admin notification fails during registration, registration still succeeds
- If user notification fails during approval, approval still succeeds
- All email failures logged to audit log for monitoring

---

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Production Testing Required

- [ ] Test new user registration with email/full_name
- [ ] Verify admin receives notification email
- [ ] Test user approval flow and notification
- [ ] Test user rejection flow and notification
- [ ] Test email sending with invalid SMTP credentials (should log warning)
- [ ] Test registration without email (should still work, skip notification)
- [ ] Verify HTML email rendering in Outlook
- [ ] Test with different email clients (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- [ ] Verify email links and formatting
- [ ] Test re-registration after rejection (should send new admin notification)

---

## Frontend Integration Required

### Next Steps

**File to Update:** Frontend registration form (location TBD)

**Required Changes:**
1. Add "Full Name" input field to registration form
2. Add "Email Address" input field to registration form
3. Update form validation to handle optional email field
4. Update registration API call to include new fields

**Example Payload:**
```json
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "password": "secure_password",
  "display_name": "John",
  "full_name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@company.com"
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Email Security
- Passwords stored in environment variables (not in code)
- Consider using MS365 app-specific passwords instead of main password
- TLS encryption enabled by default for SMTP connections
- Email addresses not exposed in public APIs

### Privacy
- Email addresses stored in database
- Only admin can view pending user emails
- Users receive notifications only to their registered email
- Admin email address configured via environment variable

---

## Monitoring

### Log Entries to Monitor

1. **Registration with email notification:**
   ```
   INFO: 가입 요청 (username: xxx)
   WARNING: 관리자 이메일 전송 실패 (if failed)
   ```

2. **User approval with notification:**
   ```
   INFO: 사용자 승인 (username: xxx)
   WARNING: 승인 이메일 전송 실패 (if failed)
   ```

3. **User rejection with notification:**
   ```
   INFO: 사용자 거절 (username: xxx, reason: xxx)
   WARNING: 거절 이메일 전송 실패 (if failed)
   ```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Email Optional:** Email field is optional - users can register without email
   - Rationale: Support legacy users and offline scenarios
   - Impact: Some users won't receive notifications

2. **Single Admin Email:** Only one admin email supported
   - Workaround: Use distribution list or shared mailbox for EMAIL_ADMIN

3. **No Email Templates Management:** Email templates hardcoded in email_service.py
   - Future Enhancement: Move to template files for easier customization

4. **No Email Queue:** Emails sent synchronously during request
   - Impact: Slight delay in registration/approval response
   - Future Enhancement: Implement async email queue

---

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received

**Check:**
1. EMAIL_ENABLED=true in environment
2. SMTP credentials correct
3. Check spam/junk folder
4. Verify EMAIL_ADMIN is correct
5. Check audit logs for "이메일 전송 실패" warnings

### SMTP Connection Errors

**Common Issues:**
- Port 587 blocked by firewall (check network settings)
- TLS version mismatch (ensure modern TLS 1.2+)
- Authentication failure (check credentials, may need app password)
- MS365 SMTP disabled (check Exchange Online settings)
