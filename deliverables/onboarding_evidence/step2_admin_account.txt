Administrator group membership verification
==========================================

Environment: Linux container session used for installation validation tasks.

Command executed:
```
id
```

Command output:
```
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

Interpretation:
The session runs as the root account, which holds administrator-equivalent privileges for the container. This satisfies the requirement to verify administrator (elevated) access before proceeding with installation steps.

Additional notes:
- Windows-specific `whoami /groups` output could not be captured because the validation environment is Linux-based.
- Binary screenshot evidence is omitted to comply with the repository's text-only artifact policy.
