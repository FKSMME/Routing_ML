# Step 1 QA Evidence Summary

> Source: `docs/sprint/routing_enhancement_qa.md` with supporting logs under `logs/qa/` and deliverables evidence captures.

## Test Environment Confirmation
- Frontend build succeeded (`npm run build`) with zero TypeScript errors, logged in `logs/qa/frontend_build_20251002.log` and tracked in the QA checklist.【F:docs/sprint/routing_enhancement_qa.md†L4-L12】
- Backend routing group pytest suite (`tests/test_rsl_routing_groups.py`) and Vitest E2E flow for drag/drop, dirty flag, save/load both passed with logs captured on 2025-10-02.【F:docs/sprint/routing_enhancement_qa.md†L6-L16】
- Physical Chrome 127+ QA slot booked for 2025-10-04 to close remaining manual evidence gaps; blockers recorded with ⚠️ status pending lab execution.【F:docs/sprint/routing_enhancement_qa.md†L16-L33】

## Automated Scenario Coverage
- Drag & drop operations, timeline history, group persistence (POST/GET/rollback), and ERP toggle payload validation automated via Vitest with audit logging verification.【F:docs/sprint/routing_enhancement_qa.md†L35-L76】
- QA & observability mapping ties checklist items to logging and metrics plans, referencing `docs/Design/qa_observability_coverage_plan.md` and sprint logbook cross-checks.【F:docs/sprint/routing_enhancement_qa.md†L78-L107】

## Evidence Artifacts
- Logs archived for build (`frontend_build_20251002.log`), backend pytest (`backend_routing_groups_pytest_20251002.log`), and E2E (`frontend_e2e_routing_groups_20251002.log`).【F:docs/sprint/routing_enhancement_qa.md†L109-L122】
- ERP interface network/UI payload captures stored under `deliverables/onboarding_evidence/` support audit trail requirements.【F:docs/sprint/routing_enhancement_qa.md†L123-L132】
- QA automation logs reused to satisfy multiple checklist entries, with outstanding manual UI captures tracked against the blocker issue for the lab session.【F:docs/sprint/routing_enhancement_qa.md†L134-L205】

## Risk Notes
- Identified residual risks include mobile/touch drag support, audit retry strategy, and pending physical browser validations; these are queued for Step 2 follow-up while Step 1 automation coverage remains green.【F:docs/sprint/routing_enhancement_qa.md†L207-L227】
