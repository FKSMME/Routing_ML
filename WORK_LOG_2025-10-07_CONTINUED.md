## [09:20] Ballpit & Orb Effects Implementation - In Progress

### Completed:
1. ✅ Created Orb component files (OGL-based WebGL shader effects)
   - `/frontend-prediction/src/components/effects/Orb.tsx`
   - `/frontend-prediction/src/components/effects/Orb.css`
   - `/frontend-training/src/components/effects/Orb.tsx`
   - `/frontend-training/src/components/effects/Orb.css`

2. ✅ Installed dependencies
   - `npm install three ogl` in both frontends
   - `npm install --save-dev @types/three` for TypeScript support

3. ✅ Created Ballpit component (Three.js 3D bouncing balls)
   - `/frontend-prediction/src/components/effects/Ballpit.tsx` (850+ lines, complex physics)
   - Copied to `/frontend-training/src/components/effects/Ballpit.tsx`

4. ✅ Created BallpitSimple component (2D Canvas fallback)
   - `/frontend-prediction/src/components/effects/BallpitSimple.tsx`
   - Simpler 2D canvas implementation for testing

5. ✅ Integrated BallpitSimple into App.tsx files
   - Modified both `/frontend-prediction/src/App.tsx` and `/frontend-training/src/App.tsx`
   - Added component to all render paths (loading, login, authenticated)

### Issue Discovered:
- **BallpitSimple component not rendering** despite successful compilation
- No canvas elements detected in DOM via Playwright verification
- No TypeScript/compilation errors in Vite output
- Login page renders correctly but background effect missing
- Backend returning 401/500 errors (authentication issues)

### Current Investigation:
- Ballpit/BallpitSimple component may be failing silently at runtime
- React Fragment wrapping might have issues
- Need to verify component is actually mounting
- z-index layering might be hiding the canvas behind other elements

### Next Steps:
1. Add console.log debugging to BallpitSimple component to verify mounting
2. Check z-index and positioning issues
3. Verify canvas is being created but possibly hidden
4. Consider simpler test case - single div with background color
5. If simple test works, gradually add canvas rendering back

### Files Modified:
- `/frontend-prediction/src/App.tsx` - Added BallpitSimple import and rendering
- `/frontend-training/src/App.tsx` - Added BallpitSimple import and rendering
- `/frontend-home/index.html` - Already has Orb effects (CSS-based, working via Playwright)

### Technical Notes:
- OGL package installed for WebGL shader-based Orb effects
- Three.js package installed for 3D Ballpit effects
- BallpitSimple uses pure 2D Canvas API (no dependencies)
- All servers running: 3000 (home), 5173 (prediction), 5174 (training), 8000 (backend)
