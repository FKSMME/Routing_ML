# IndexedDB Persistence QA Log (2025-09-29)

## Summary
- Confirmed the new `frontend/src/lib/persistence/indexedDbPersistence.ts` utility saves routing workspace snapshots and audit queue entries with `idb-keyval`.
- Verified graceful fallback paths when `indexedDB` is unavailable to avoid runtime errors in non-browser or restricted environments.

## Execution Details
- 2025-09-29T23:20:57Z — `npm run test -- --run tests/unit/indexedDbPersistence.test.ts tests/e2e/routing-groups.spec.ts`
  - Result: ✅ PASS
  - Notes: Validated fallback behaviour unit tests and ensured routing store e2e harness still loads mocked persistence layer.

## Edge Cases Evaluated
- IndexedDB unavailable (`globalThis.indexedDB = undefined`) → `writeRoutingWorkspaceSnapshot`/`enqueueAuditEntry` return `persisted=false`; reads return empty results without throwing.
- Snapshot pruning thresholds maintained at five entries to prevent unbounded growth; audit queue capped at fifty entries.
- Crypto API absence handled via timestamp-based ID fallback.

## Follow-up Actions
- Wire the snapshot utility into the planned server sync adapter and extend QA coverage to include browser-based IndexedDB smoke tests.
